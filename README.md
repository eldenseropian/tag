### Description

Find your way from #start to #finish by navigating through the hashtags of
Instagram photos!

You are presented with four Instagram images, each tagged with the randomly
selected "start" tag. Your goal is to find an Instagram image that is tagged
with the "end" tag. To do this, select one of the four images and click on a
tag. Four more images, each tagged by that new tag, will pop up. If you see the
"end" tag, click on it! Otherwise, rinse and repeat!
